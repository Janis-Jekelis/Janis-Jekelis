"I have had  interest in coding and PC hardware since elementary school. In 2023, I decided to further pursue my passion by taking up coding classes.
I am currently working at Codelex where I expand my knowlege of various programming languages and software development methodologies. 
Apart from my academic pursuits, I enjoy tinkering with PC hardware and assembling my own computers.
I find the process of building a computer from scratch to be both challenging and rewarding.
